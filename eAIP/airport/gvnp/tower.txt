==== Runway Selection ====
  
  * The preferred Runway at GVNP is Runway 03 as the majority of the time the wind favors Runway 03. 

==== Runway Change Operations ====

  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing TWR, (DEP) and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxing on a taxiway opposite to the departure runway, coordinate with (DEP) and APP controllers to place that aircraft for the runway its headed for.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.
