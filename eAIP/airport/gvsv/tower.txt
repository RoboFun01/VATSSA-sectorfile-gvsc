  * Runway 24 should only be used if the tailwind component is equal or greater than 10 knots.


==== Runway Change Operations ====

  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing DEL, GND, TWR, DEP and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxying on Twy C or A, offer the pilot the option to backtrack the existing active Rwy or to enter the runway for taxiway direction change.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.
